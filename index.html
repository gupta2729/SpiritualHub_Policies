    <h1>Privacy Policy for Hanuman Chalisa Suno</h1>

    <p>Effective date: June 2025</p>

    <p>
        Hanuman Chalisa Suno ("we", "our", or "us") operates the mobile application "Hanuman Chalisa Suno" (the "App"). This Privacy Policy informs you about how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our App.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>Our app is designed to provide audio playback of the Hanuman Chalisa and display related text. We do not collect any personal information from users directly. The only data we may access includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> To ensure smooth audio playback and app operation, we may access basic device information like OS version and device model for compatibility purposes.</li>
        <li><strong>Media and Notifications:</strong> We use media playback services and display notifications to provide audio controls. This is done locally on your device and no data is sent to any external server.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Audio Source</h2>
    <p>
        The audio of the Hanuman Chalisa used in this app is sourced from a third-party platform with proper authorization. We do not claim ownership of the audio content.
    </p>

    <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>
        Since we do not collect personal data, we use device information only to:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Provide uninterrupted audio playback.</li>
        <li>Display notifications for audio controls.</li>
        <li>Improve app performance and compatibility.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
    <p>
        We do not share, sell, or disclose your personal information to any third parties. The app operates entirely on your device and does not transmit data externally.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Storage of Data</h2>
    <p>
        The app does not store personal data externally. Audio files and resources are packaged within the app. Any caching or temporary data is stored locally on your device and is managed by the operating system.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Permissions</h2>
    <p>
        The app requests minimal permissions necessary for media playback and notification display. These include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Audio playback and media controls</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Notification access</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        Our app does not target or knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us immediately.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Security</h2>
    <p>
        We take reasonable measures to protect the integrity and security of the app and its content. Since personal data is not collected or transmitted, risk of data breaches is minimized.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We encourage you to review it periodically. Changes will be posted here with an updated effective date.
